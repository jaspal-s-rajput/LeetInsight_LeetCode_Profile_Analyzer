Frontend Preview: https://your-github-username.github.io/LeetInsight_LeetCode_Analytics_Dashboard/

◻️ Overview

LeetInsight is a web-based LeetCode analytics dashboard that fetches user statistics via GraphQL and presents them through dynamic visual components. It provides a structured performance overview including solved problems, rank, streak, acceptance rate, and difficulty-wise metrics in a single interactive interface.

◻️ Problem Statement

LeetCode profiles expose large amounts of performance data but lack a compact, visual, and user-friendly analytics view. LeetInsight solves this by aggregating profile metrics and transforming them into clear visual indicators and charts for faster performance assessment.

◻️ User Scope

Enter LeetCode username -> Fetch public profile statistics -> View solved counts and rank -> Analyze difficulty-wise performance -> View streak and active day metrics.
